# ZOUDIO AIO438 firmware
Public firmware releases for the ZOUDIO AIO438 amplifier:
<br>https://github.com/ZOUDIO/AIO438-firmware-releases/releases
<br>Always use the latest firmware available unless you have been instructed otherwise.

<br>Firmware is in binary format (.hex) and can be uploaded to the board using the ZOUDIO configtool (zoudio.com/configtool)
<br>Uploading unknown binaries to the board voids your warranty

The AIO438 can be connected to a PC via its onboard USB-C port.
Normally, the ZOUDIO configtool can be used to communicate with the board.
Commands can also be send via a regulator terminal at 38400 baudrate, 8N1 format.

The serial protocol has two sides:
- Human-readable (ASCII) for standard commands
<br>Simple human-readable, can be used by anyone. See CLI description down below.

- Binary protocol for DSP data transfer
<br>Complex and not suitable for humans. These commands are used for large data transfer like DSP settings, normally generated by the configtool.

Default state of the board is low power standby.
<br>Sending a command or pressing the volume button wakes it up.
<br>The configtool just sends ECHO commands until the board wakes up and responds.

## ASCII command line interface (CLI):
| Command         | Response example        | Details                                                           |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ECHO            | ECHO                    | Used to see if board is responding                                |
| MODEL           | AIO438                  | Returns board model                                               |
| FIRMWARE        | 1.2.3                   | Returns firmware version                                          |
| DISABLE         | -                       | Puts amplifier into low-power shutdown                            |
| VOL (db)        | -30                     | No argument returns current volume in decibel. Argument can be entered to set volume. Range from -103.5 to +24dB, limited by maximum volume set in configtool |
| STATUS          | list                    | Returns detailed status report                                    |
| BT (en)         | Bluetooth enabled: true | (en) = DISABLE or ENABLE. Non-volatile setting, applied at reboot. Disables the bluetooth module, usually used to provide an external I2S input
| DEFAULT_ON (en) | Default on: false       | (en) = DISABLE or ENABLE. Non-volatile setting, applied at reboot. Used to change the default boot state to be enabled |

- (argument) is a user-provided argument with the unit mentioned for the specific command.
- The default response to a command is a non-acknowledge (nAck) message: "nAck: (command)"
